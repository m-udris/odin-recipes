    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the ground beef, Italian sausage, and
                diced onion over medium heat until the meat is browned. Add the minced
                garlic and cook for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine
                (if using). Add the sugar, basil, parsley, salt, black pepper, Italian
                seasoning, and red pepper flakes (if using).
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer the sauce on low heat for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                The longer it simmers, the better the flavors will meld together.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese mixture</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley,
                and salt. Mix until well blended.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package
                instructions. Drain and rinse them with cold water to prevent them from sticking
                together.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping them slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce over the mozzarella.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat these layers two more times, ending with the remaining meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the top with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and the grated Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it doesn't touch the cheese
                (you can use toothpicks to prop it up if necessary).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Let it Rest:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before serving.
                This will help it set and make it easier to cut into neat slices.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Serve the lasagna with a side salad and some garlic bread for a complete meal. Enjoy!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
