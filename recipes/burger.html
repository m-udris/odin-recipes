    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Patties:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder,
                and Worcestershire sauce. Mix gently until all ingredients are just combined; do not overmix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty, about 3/4-inch
                thick.Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them
                from puffing up during cooking.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Patties:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or grill over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>
                Once the oil is hot, add the patties to the skillet or place them on the grill. Cook for about
                3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until desired doneness is reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                If adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover the
                skillet or close the grill lid to melt the cheese.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Toast the Buns:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While the patties are cooking, you can toast the hamburger buns. Place the buns, cut side down,
                on the grill or in a separate skillet over medium heat. Toast until they are golden brown, about
                1-2 minutes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Burgers:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, and/or mayonnaise on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked patty on top of the condiments.</li>
            <li>Add lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles as desired.</li>
            <li>Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Serve the burgers immediately with your favorite sides, such as french fries, onion rings, or
                a fresh salad. Enjoy!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
